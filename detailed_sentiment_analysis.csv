Not to also mention a Missing Persons Report, So be mindful and don\'t use the fact that your Colleagues and Employers treated you so Terribly Cloud up your Judgement towards others because people will permanently and forever Dislike you More and like you less...Exactly how people lose other People as Friends because of that, as for my own Experiences with Facebook in the past and recent years...Well would\'ve been Nice if the facebook site would\'ve not only treated their Employees Better, but also if they had Improved the Options on their Site for people and other male and Female Users...Well, more that most likely referring to how they used to back in the earlier years which they clearly don\'t even do anymore except if they decide to change up their page layout of course.!!! <3 (Y) <3', '\u200b@Gaurav Pandey  Me Neither, that was kind of the whole entire point of these sort of companies and favourite social media sites of a lot people and users...Truth is if you\'re actually planning up to become a Private Company Organization and/or-Multi/Million-Dollar/Corporation-Company/Staff-Employee or even of a Billion Dollar Company Privately or Public, well then these sort of types of things shouldn\'t even bother and annoy the hell of you or anyone else or even anybody who\'s actually thinking up about weather or not they want to work there and is really just planning on making money for a living out of employment without spending too much Money and Saving more which is actually a Good and (""Great"") Idea for the Future for those who are planning on making enough Money to afford becoming a Student for another Job\'s Job Course or School even both and plus or at the same time...So why would anybody or anyone else be stupid but yet Unreasonable Enough just to Complain and tell their employer to eff themselves in order just to get Fired rather than actually Asking them what can I do or could have done in order to become a better Employer or even about why do they dislike the fact personally about him having his own YouTube Channel...Like for examples, was it something about them or the way how I had talked about it on my videos as two personal Questions to their Employer before actually giving them hell for it or even rather than doing that at all...If you really love your Career Job, well then you should ask them questions first before doing anything unreasonable after having them tell you about why it exactly is that they just specifically and simply don\'t and do not exactly and does not like nor enjoys your YouTube Channel...Simple, most Employees would actually just Tired and Fed Up super very easily with the actual company that they Ex Formerly worked for just because of the way they actually do things there when in reality the Staff Members were actually really very nice and kind and Thoughtful plus Friendly, it\'s just that the company wants them to do things a certain way and part of that also has to do with their Privacy Policy and Terms of Condition for Employees which it seems like his former colleagues don\'t Support him either along with the Employer and his YouTube Haters calling him a Troll and an Amazing Ahwful because of his Amazing and Awful Life at the same time based on what he\'s saying here on YouTube...so yeah, because of that I\'m also pretty sure that another part of the reason they fired him from Facebook and YouTube prior to that was because they were also at the same time Offended by his words and plus not to mention the fact that even before he was hired there that he was actually already doing this already...But the fact that he\'s Monetizing his Posts and Channel for both Facebook and YouTube as reasons to fire him are Outrageous...I\'m actually one of his Supporters but even me myself may not always support everything he\'s doing on his videos while they may be others that I might actually Support Him on still, he never really fully explained except for maybe a little bit about why people\'s facebook\'s posts and updates bothered him but I\'m pretty sure that it was partly because his video would be too long in minutes and would rather do a continuation video instead so I can not only understand why others would be Angry with him but also where he\'s coming from picturing myself in his shoes...But telling people who they should and shouldn\'t treat their family when these millionaires have no clue nor idea on their videos what kinds of things these people are going through, some of these other people who are being attacked by these millions are probably even being Verbally or Emotionally if not just Physically Abused by Their biological parents and In Laws and the reasons for why they\'re Angry or Furious with Their biological parents and/or-their/in-laws is NONE of these Millionaire\'s Business at all which is pretty Jerkish plus Nosy.!!! So even it\'s not neccessarily being said for Jerkish Reasons and is really just trying to get everybody to get along, well these millionaires are still looking at it one sidedly which that within it\'s own self is a form of Extreme Bullying.!!! I actually like this guy, I just wouldn\'t want him Opinionwise based on the onesidedness only expecting things to constantly be positive rather than taking a Negative and turning it into a Positive Rather instead...Would\'ve been ashamed of him if I was his Teenage Son having to always Apologize on behalf of my own Father, but what he doesn\'t realize on this current video is that he also has the version of handsome that also is worth forgiving too so his opinions are relatable but yet Privacy Invasively One Sided Understandably.!!! <3 (Y) But as much as I may never support the fact that he\'s looking at other people fighting with their Families or Laws in a one sided way saying that they could\'ve handled the situation differently without even considering their Personal Reasons for it, well at the same time calling people Immature without even giving out certain specific types of situations completely different but similar to yours and wife\'s on your other video about why she left that has nothing to do with you except for other people in this world and Community is something that you should learn to mind and respect...Very Simple.!!! <3 (Y)', 'I loved the video you made of the HR!

So whats half of 12? Ummm 6, the Ps5 is 10.3. So with the Ps4 being 1.8 the Pro gpu is more closer to 60% over the OG Ps4 . So the Ps5 would have to be closer to5.5 Tflops for the xbsXs gpu to be 60% more powerfull. Also less CUs @ a higher clock can also outperform more CUs @ a lower clock. XbsXs gpu has a 17%-18% power advantage over the Ps5 no where near 50-60%.

They were baptized in the water and of the spirit. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled with the Holy Ghost and rising again from the dead. That's what Acts 2:38 is.\nWe must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD.\nWe can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritan. Our salvation has to match-up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.\nEternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.\nGod told Noah exactly how to be saved, how he must build the ark. Noah didn't come up with his own plan like people are doing today. A sinner's prayer, you just have to believe, etc which is not in the bible.\nThe gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.\nIt's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, They continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. Jesus Christ truly loves you. Do you truly love him?

Actually, there is a way to use an image like that online right now. You see, the way that ""Virtual Spot"" works, is that it captures an entire series of images of whatever you are photographing<including yourself>. It does so by taking one still frame after another in sequence. These can be downloaded into your computer. The way that you can use these in social media, is to take your ""Virtual Spot"" images and convert them into an ""Animated Gif."" Essentially, what you are doing with those ""Virtual Spot"" images, is converting them to a short video, which is exactly what an ""Animated Gif"" actually is. Gif images are used online quite extensively and are created to play in loops, over and over.\n\nThere are a host of ""Gif Maker"" software available online for downloading. Some higher end ones must be paid for, but there are quite a few available for free download and unlimited use. Once you create a ""Gif"" image, it can be safely uploaded online and posted wherever you want, including on social media.  It\'s only a simple matter of uploading a video. The gif can be configured to play automatically when selected. I just wanted to point that out so that you don\'t need to wait for specialty software for using ""Virtual Spot"" images.

I never worked with the 128k, but I programmed on the Apple II line extensively. One of the major challenges I faced as a developer working with the Apple II was the lack of good C compilers. Since the 6502 processor was more suited for assembly language, I ended up spending hours learning and writing assembly code just to get my projects moving forward. I often wrote small sections of code in assembly and then hand-optimized them to fit into the quirky memory architecture. I even designed my own makeshift stack management system to handle the hardware limitations, though it was more of a patchwork solution than something elegant.\n\nIn one particular project, I was trying to implement a small game, and the limited stack space nearly drove me crazy. I ended up breaking down complex functions into smaller subroutines just to avoid running out of stack memory. It was a frustrating but invaluable lesson in efficiency, forcing me to think about how to conserve every byte of space and CPU cycle. Anyhow, this limitation stemmed partly from the 6502 processor's unconventional memory structure. Rather than using a straightforward memory model, the 6502 had a small scratchpad and relied on special addressing modes to access different parts of memory. Its instruction set was even more peculiar than the 80X86, making it far better suited for lightweight assembly programming rather than handling more complex operating systems.\n\nAnother issue was the restricted execution stack, both in terms of size and where it could be placed. To get around this, a custom stack solution had to be implemented in software, further complicating development. Dealing with the restricted execution stack on the Apple II was one of the trickiest challenges. The stack was small and locked into a specific memory location, which made it hard to manage anything complex. I had to be extremely careful with function calls and recursion since the native stack just couldn't handle anything too deep or complex. In one case, I was trying to develop a simple recursive algorithm, and the system would crash every time because the stack would overflow. Wasn't fun.\n\nWhat made the Apple II stand out in its time was the way it offloaded hardware functions, such as disk data encoding and head positioning, to software, keeping hardware costs down. However, this approach had its drawbacks, as it forced software to manage hardware in real-time, monopolizing the CPU for extended periods to handle these tasks. I remember one particular time when I was working on a disk utility for the Apple II where this was made abundently clear to me. The task involved managing disk data encoding and handling the drive‚Äôs head positioning, something that was usually managed by dedicated hardware in more modern machines. But on the Apple II, I had to write software to manage these low-level operations directly. This meant writing complex routines to handle the disk‚Äôs head movement and encoding the data correctly on the fly. It felt like I was working more on hardware-level code than application code at times. The downside, though, was that this approach meant the CPU was entirely consumed during these operations. I remember having to carefully schedule my software to avoid missing any crucial real-time tasks, like ensuring the disk didn‚Äôt lose data when switching between reading and writing.\n\nAs hardware has evolved and become more affordable, with smarter components handling functions independently, the Apple II‚Äôs method of shifting tasks to software has become less practical. While it did save on hardware costs, it complicated software development and limited the system's overall potential.¬®\n\n\nAnyhoo, good memories."", 'The ARM1 processor was developed in just 18 months.

IBM PCs started to become popular in the 80\'s, but they were too expensive for home users until the BIOS was cloned by Phoenix and others and cheap clones became common.  Apple II and Atari computers were good for gaming, and there were a few business applications.  However, the Apple II and most early computers were only 8-bit, so very limited in memory and with only 40-column displays.  The IBM PC had a lot of RAM for the time (up to 640 Kb) and a high-resolution 80-column display.  Lotus 123 (spreadsheet) and WordPerfect (Word Processor) quickly became popular and it was a common business tool very quickly, although networking took a little longer.\nI used the original Mac in 1984, and you had to swap disks constantly, so doing anything--even simple word processing, was a major pain.  It really wasn\'t really very useful, although the GUI environment was quite stunning.  You could print anything on screen, but printing was very slow and low-resolution.  When the ""Fat Mac"" \'(512 Kb) came out, the disk swapping was reduced and hard disks made it better still, although early Mac hard disks very very slow and expensive.  Even so, the Mac didn\'t really become popular with business until the Apple LaserWriter was invented.  This created the desktop publishing business and made the Mac a unique and very useful business tool, although it never caught on generally with businesses because it was so expensive.  A Mac and LaserWriter cost almost as much as a car. \nBy th late 80\'s, early versions of Windows were out, and there were other GUI computers like the Atari ST and Amiga that were cheaper than Macs (and had color screens).  Windows 3.1 around 1990 was comparable to Macs in many ways and really shifted the momentum of the undustry back to PCs and Windows.  Macs grew less popular and almost died off, before the iMac in the late 1990\'s made them popular again.\nIt\'s easy for current Mac users to get nostalgic about Macs, but for the 1980\'s and 90\'s, they were very much niche products and very expensive.

The Mac was a lot more expensive, there was almost no software for it, and it didn\'t support aftermarket h/w cards.

Ironically, in stark contrast to the libertarian philosophy used to introduce the Macintosh computer to the world via a SuperBowl commercial, Apple and other ""Big Tech"" companies (such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, et. al.) have created the very dystopian surveillance and mind control world that the novel 1984 portended through their harvesting and collection of the personal data of the users of their hardware and software.', 'The reason that tech (or office computers specifically) at that time was that drab beige is because of a study that IBM conducted in their German office to determine the least obtrusive color for office equipment (such as typewriters or the original IBM PC or DisplayWriter).

It wasn‚Äôt funny the 20th time I heard it! And it definitely didn‚Äôt get funnier the more you say it!!! That thing is not a Sith! He doesn‚Äôt have force powers! The only reason he can do anything that could be considered Jedi like is because the writers (not mainly George Lucas) were trying so hard make another character that fans would love and buy all of their toys that they ignored the rules that they came up with in the SWU! And any time they wrote that character into a corner where he would have been a goner they once again broke their own rules to make sure he stayed alive! And when that awful theory popped up they also tried to test the waters to see how many people would love the idea. And after what I think was that episode that had him ‚Äúdressed‚Äù as a Jedi I‚Äôm pretty sure it was done for after that!?! But for some God odd reason a small group of people kept going with it! And when the internet trolls found out people were annoyed by and tired of that theory they jumped on board! If it was in any way true that he was (not that the writers thought about it and it never happened) a force user then 1) he would have popped up multiple times throughout 4 through 9! And 2) since the rule of two exists then the people that want to believe that horrible theory is true also are saying that either Palps and Darth Vader are not the true Sith or just Darth Vader isn‚Äôt! Because Jar Jar was still ‚Äúalive‚Äù after order 66!', '2:42:50- I always wondered why that was?!? I don‚Äôt remember if I saw something covering it but it brings up the question why the senate automatically assumed they knew who was in the wrong!', '2:42:51- Which is kinda funny clear evidence that brings up the big question again‚Ä¶.. and that‚Äôs who is really the bad guys?!? Some times even those that truly want to be good can unfortunately add the bad guys by helping them!', '2:42:14- ‚ÄúClose friends‚Äù?!? Yeah, I guess that‚Äôs one way of looking at them!?!', '2:17:22- Um, no‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ That is not true around 85-90% of the time!!! I‚Äôm not going to dive as deep into this because let‚Äôs be honest, if anyone is reading this they probably already shut off after I said that‚Äôs not true! But unfortunately the ones that normally succeed and climb up most ladders faster than any other and higher than most are the ones that are ruthless enough that their willing to knock over, step on, crush and destroy literally anyone in their path including friends and family and those that are also going after something they want!!! Yeah, your version sounds better and is filled with hope and the understanding that if you‚Äôre a good person and you work really hard you can do anything! But unfortunately in the real world those hopes are only filled with lies‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ just like the lie that all are created equal! If that was true then all can become the greatest basketball, baseball, football and so on players to ever live. It would also mean everyone learns and grows at the exact same pace. And also that everyone can be the best at music and art and pretty much anything else that people normally strive for! Yes, no one gets there without hard work and determination but from each single person that succeeds in their field there are 10s of thousands of others that mostly worked as hard if not harder but eventually failed! Everyone is made for one thing! And if that person goes against what they were made for they will almost always be faced with failure‚Ä¶. And in my cynical view on life now because of my failures some may be here just to fail in the first place but to also learn from it and ‚Äúso called‚Äù because stronger from each one. And yes, this is the shorter version and yes I could have dove WAY deeper into this than I did!!! But like I said, even the people that kept reading to this point stopped hearing me near the beginning', 'WARNING: This is another long comment and it‚Äôs just me using SW as a example to dive deep into our real world! It has very little to actually do with SW so most should probably skip. And if you also don‚Äôt like long comments you should also skip!!! And please do so without crying that my comments are too long and no one cares! Oh, I know most people don‚Äôt care about others! And that‚Äôs the majority of most of my points throughout everything I say and do!!! \n\n1:01:25- And also it‚Äôs against the ‚Äúrules of war‚Äù (or whatever they call it in the SW universe!?! Honestly, right now I can‚Äôt remember the exact name for it in the real world either?!? Lol  I was about to say ‚Äúthe Geneva convention‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think this issue is apart of that!?! I might be right and wrong and it actually is part of that but my brain hasn‚Äôt woke up yet!?! But it‚Äôs another great metaphor for how majority of the real world sees and views everything and everyone else! The term good guy and bad guys is determined by the actions of each side or who started it! It‚Äôs determined by what side you are on and normally by who wins! The best example that I could use (that won‚Äôt be dismissed once I say the sides names and never even get to the why) is America and it‚Äôs founding fathers!!! Since America clearly won and has been free from Englands control for a very long time we view them as patriots and like I already said, our founding fathers! But I bet you a whole Star Destroyer that England didn‚Äôt see it that way! From their point of view they were traitors and guilty of treason against their crown and country. And if England won all of those that fought for freedom would have been sentenced to death and executed and either erased from history or would have gone down as traders and pure evil for tricking others into following them! And if it was the 2nd option that happened kids would have learned about all the horrific things ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù did during the war and not the other way around!!! And also it kinda brings up something else to! Most people don‚Äôt understand or get this or they choose not to (I don‚Äôt know, I wasn‚Äôt ever one of these people! So I can‚Äôt say for certain) what actually defines the difference between ‚Äúa reason‚Äù and ‚Äúa excuse‚Äù!?! What truly chooses which is what is the person or persons you are telling! Not the one talking!!! Those that are being told are the ones that can determine if what their hearing is a good reason for something or just a bad excuse!', '53:59- I can. But what I thought was really going on splits into two options. 1st one is that Anakin did see the similarities but if he excepted that as facts then he would also be admitting to being a slaver! Because it doesn‚Äôt matter what anyone would want to believe, if those that ‚Äúhave to‚Äù follow your orders are slaves. Then you are the master! One of many masters in this case. But a master none the less!!! And 2nd is the fact that if he allowed that thought to dwell in his subconscious for too long he knew the only outcome that he would be able to live with is trying to free them! And that would 100% lose the war for the Republic!!! So he dismissed it as quickly as it was said! It‚Äôs way easier to hear only what you want to hear and always see yourself as the good guy over taking the chance that you actually could be to blame for any wrong doing!!! And it‚Äôs actually a great message to how most people in real life act and think‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ abut it was also a message that was dismissed and lost as quickly as it came!!!', '36:43- I just learned something new there! Ok, no more learning for the day lol jk I knew Palps knew but I didn‚Äôt know why or how!?! Makes sense!', '24:59- I always forget what form is which number!?! Isn‚Äôt form 3 the more defensive form? Um‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Who was famous for using it?!? Um‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. The only one I can think of right now and is one of the main reasons why I loved and started to learn how to do it myself is Darth Zana (I don‚Äôt think I spelt that right)!?! Darth Bane‚Äôs apprentice! And I‚Äôm not even going to attempt to spell the actual name of the form lol either way that‚Äôs the form I love the most! I got kinda good at it for awhile but then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ life happened and I haven‚Äôt trained since. But I am taller than the average male but I was never that strong and I definitely didn‚Äôt ever look intimidating! So that was another reason why I went that route! Very little energy waisted defending until my opponent tied themselves out and then strike!', 'SHORTER VERSION OF MY LAST COMMENT: This comment is just the question that‚Äôs at the end of the longer version but without all the information that had to draw my conclusion! So the question is, does anyone actually know who‚Äôs to blame for all of these that happened? The Clone Wars and all the way up until the Empire is born?!? There has been many that have been blamed but I have never seen the correct people amongst those! There could be something out there that blames this person but I haven‚Äôt seen it! Yet!!!', 'WARNING: This comment is really long!!!  I mean really really long lol So if you can‚Äôt handle long comments with a question at the end please just skip this!!! I don‚Äôt feel like hearing anything person cry about how I‚Äôm ‚Äúwriting a book‚Äù! And no one is forcing you to read my comment in the first place! Either way, have a great day and may the force always guide you!!!\n\nI‚Äôm not done with this video yet and I‚Äôm not sure how many videos there are for the whole war but I wanted to ask something before I forget to ask! So I know it is quite possible that you do mention it somewhere in this or one of the other videos covering this war (which I kinda doubt since you already pasted that part! But I follow a good deal of SW YouTubers and from what I‚Äôve watched of each I have heard people blaming a lot of different people for the war itself and for being the reason why the Sith were able to win and take over the galaxy!!! In no order Anakin Skywalker (which in a very few ways, kinda‚Ä¶. But the ball was already rolling way before he had a say in anything! And yes, he could have tried to just take care of Palps himself once he finally found out the truth! But I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever really put any thought into that!?!? He could have fought Palps right there and then but dose anyone actually think it would have been a quick fight?!? No way! So after the fight starts the first chance Palps had for a quick break he would have called in Order 66! So all those Jedi that died would still die and Anakin would have had a choice to make‚Ä¶ continue the fight and maybe win or possibly lose and now he‚Äôs dead and no help to anyone or leave the fight and try to help in any way he could. The second one has loads of options and paths he could have taken but I won‚Äôt go into that insane amount of detail without being asked!?! But everything would still play out the same for the most part. And the possibility of him dying was really good! And therefore he wouldn‚Äôt be there to toss Palps down that tunnel to the big light bright at the bottom), Obi-Wan Kenobi (but that one makes less sense than the first one! The only thing he could have done is be a little faster I guess to save his master!?! But that would also make it his masters fault for not getting lost in a losing fight and realizing that he needed to go on the defensive and not charge in at Darth Maul so his apprentice could get there and help finish off the Sith! And also once again, the ball was already in motion before the duel of the fates even began), Jar Jar Binks (now I‚Äôd like to clear this up first! I hate this character! He is horrible and one of the main reasons why Episodes 1, 2 and 3 were so bad!!! Jinn should have let him be ran over by that tank in the forest! Anyways, he was the one that put in motion the vote for Palps to be granted the extreme power over the senate that he had for the most part of the war! But who put that DA Binks in the position to do that?!? He is either just very stupid or he really was mentally challenged and therefore that wouldn‚Äôt be his fault. But neither option is a reason to put him in that position in the first place!!! And that horrible theory about him being a Sith was literally the worst thing ever made in all of SW) and a few others that the background on why is so weak I‚Äôm not even going to bring it up! But the one person that should have gotten all the blame, the one person that actually got the ball rolling in the first place and the one person that could be blamed for the beginning, the end and so much more in the middle of the whole thing has never been mentioned!!! I just don‚Äôt get that!?! I feel like there might be a political or societal reason behind why‚Ä¶.. but my brain runs on facts and logic! Not what others deem appropriate or what could be considered offensive!!! Just facts and logic ( which I‚Äôve always known my brain and the way I think of things was and is completely different from major of other people. But that‚Äôs mainly because of my disabilities I was born with‚Ä¶, unfortunately)! I doubt anyone will read this whole thing (most people won‚Äôt dedicate this much time and effort into someone they don‚Äôt know and isn‚Äôt famous‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ or kinda famous! And for the most part I‚Äôm neither) but I wonder if anyone can figure out who I‚Äôm talking about even though with everything in this comment it ‚ÄúSHOULD‚Äù be obvious! But we‚Äôll see, does anyone know who is really to blame for all that happened? If so answer with a reply?!? I guess I‚Äôll make a shorter version with just the question‚Ä¶..', '0:39- So I started this awhile ago (and made it past this part but I restarted it) but never had the chance to watch the whole thing until now!

Wokeness gone too far when it invades my SW', '1:28:49', 'WARNING: This comment is long and it‚Äôs just going over the deeper meaning behind what this YouTuber is covering. And maybe even deeper than he will cover after this time stamp! So if you don‚Äôt like diving into the deeper meanings of shows and movies like this and others and/or just can‚Äôt handle long comments then you should definitely skip this one!!! Honestly, I don‚Äôt ever expect a reply most of the time and when I do it‚Äôs rarely a intelligent reply!!!\n\n1:37:06- Yup, that‚Äôs also points out the (what should clearly be) obvious fact of everything in life is always based on the point of view the information is coming from!!! One Sade may call someone a hero but the other side may also call them a villain! And I find it somewhat hilarious that when people debate (argue) about the moral high ground and who is guiltless and who is guilty majority of parties claim their opinions and point of view is not those things, but is the facts and the only truth! And because of that the majority of those people in the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù are too pig headed to even hear their opponent! Let alone actually allow the thought that they could be wrong to ever enter their minds!!! And it also has a huge impact in when two parents are telling the history of a event to another person to judge who is or isn‚Äôt right! Majority of people will bend the truth in their favor to make it look like their guiltless and the 3rd party normally will determine that the truth is somewhere in the middle! But then you have a very small group of people (and because of this and how they actually call things as they are and not how people want to see them they are normally loners and have only 1 or 2 friends‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ maybe‚Ä¶. Mostly they are loners because everyone else wants them to break their own moral code so it would benefit them and since they don‚Äôt they lose friends fairly quickly) that walk in the middle! When they tell someone about the history of a event they will speak of what actually happened no matter if it makes them look guilty or not! And since they are so rare most people won‚Äôt even be able to recognize those people when they see them. And since they are loners they never really have anyone to back them up and the majority of people think those people are just faker than themselves because either they just can‚Äôt understand why someone would be like that or because if they would admit people have the ability to be like that then they would also have to acknowledge that they are A holes for the sake of being a A hole! Anyways, the downside to being that person is the 3rd party still thinks the truth is somewhere in the middle so therefore the conclusion they come to is way further on the liars side of their truth than it is to the real middle ground called the truth! And because of that the small amount of people that are like that see no benefit for being that way and therefore even less stay like that!!! And then you have the group of people that pretend to be that way when it benefits them and/or the consequences of your actions are so minor that there‚Äôs no real reason to lie so they can use it to their benefit later on when bigger things come up!!!', '1:15:25- Lol That was a good movie!', '1:13:54- This is once again another thing I didn‚Äôt really get!?! I know for the storyline to make sense and for the protagonist to be able to connect the dots that Separatist would have to leave some behind! But I remember this episodes (I think there were 2 or 3) and I watched them all a few times. But this the one I‚Äôm talking about (the one that takes place in this time stamp) there are NO colonist left!? They were all taken! I am 97% certain that they do not show a single native on this planet after Anakin, Ashoka and the clones kill off all the droids in that one village!?! Yeah, they could be hiding. But I doubt they would still be hiding once they realize that all the droids guarding them are disposed of and they are freed‚Ä¶.. again!', '1:10:01- I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúin cold blood‚Äù!?! Obviously this would be considered one of those moral arguments! If you think taking any human life is murder then you would also be saying that the soldiers in our own real military that have seen combat and have had to take lives to ‚Äúdefend our freedoms‚Äù are also murderers! And the same for someone that takes someone else‚Äôs life that broke into their house and may want to kill you and your family would be also true! That way of thinking is a slippery slope and if you just classify something as you see it and not take into account everything that led up to it you will quickly turn yourself into a hypocrite!!! And I won‚Äôt even go into the other forum of death because that‚Äôs a very touchy subject for a lot of people and that would make this comment more then twice as long as it already is! But in this case this D bag has already been found guilty of treason and even admitted to it! Which the punishment for said crime is death! Rex seemed like he couldn‚Äôt carrying out the punishment so the other clone did! It‚Äôs a execution, not a ‚Äúcold blooded murder‚Äù! And the death sentence is a whole a whole Nother topic that could go on forever also!!!', '1:02:51- See I always thought it was part of Palps grand plan!?! Obviously this is just a theory of mine and it could be wrong but I thought Palps knew that this 4 armed D bag was getting sick and tired of the Republic and of the Jedi Order and that he ‚Äúhad‚Äù to work with the clones which he doesn‚Äôt even think they are good enough to be considered 3rd class citizens! Anyways, it was Palms plan to F with Anakin so getting someone close to him killed and in a way that somewhat looks like it‚Äôs his own fault. But Rex probably wouldn‚Äôt die with Anakin right by his side! So yeah, take him off the battlefield and let the traitor D bag do what he does best! Send clones to their death!!! There is more to my theory but this is the nitty gritty of it!!!', '56:57- OMG wow!!! The stupid is strong in this one!!!', '53:07- Um, I thought the blockade was because of depths that the planet received because the Separatist were pissy that they didn‚Äôt have free reign to take over whatever they wanted on that planet! So their excuse was that it was back debt the planet owned because they were supposed to pay more than what they did!?!? I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs how the movie played it out and I didn‚Äôt find much on this information when doing my research other than it hinting at what I just said! Either way now I have the order/prop (or whatever it‚Äôs called) number so I can re look that up by that! I would say I have something else I will also need to fix in my book. But when the main character talked about the blockade he is talking about it from the viewpoint of a citizen that was a kid at that time on the planet and not a narrator or government official that would have all the information! I do love learning new things so thanks for that!!!', '45:32- I‚Äôm not even going to attempt to spell these guys names (I have never been a great speller and these names I can barely pronounce them)! But was the main Shark head dude one of the ancestors of the first 100 that was brought up and taught everything? Because depending on how that member of the 100 did and viewed them being brought up there might put more of a backstory to those after him and would also thicken the plot of why he did what he did!?! I know I know, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a kids show‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. kinda‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry, I know SW is supposed to be for kids but in some of it there was a high number of violence and somewhat graphic scenes throughout the movies and the shows!!! But before Disney took over the depth of history and knowledge of pretty much everything was rich with information!!! Like if you compared the information that you can find out about our real world to a single populated planet in SW the amount of information is pretty close to each other (obviously that depends greatly on what planet you pick and how long it‚Äôs been since civilization discovered it!?! And that‚Äôs just 1 planets out of the millions of planets (that lore tells us that exist) in the galaxy!!! And since I was trying so hard to get everything right for the graphic novel I was trying to write and maybe some day get published I had to do a lot of research! And oh boy, that well is deep! Very very deep indeed!! I did get 1 or 2 things wrong and didn‚Äôt notice until my second draft. But that‚Äôs because there is contradicting stories on that information and I can‚Äôt tell which is Canon and which is Legends!?!', '30:40- I could be wrong ( it is supposed to be pretty far away and he‚Äôs tiny but) in this picture on this time stamp is that a Storm trooper in the front of the larger‚Ä¶.. um‚Ä¶.. tree house?!? I know there are some mostly white Wookiee‚Äôs but I‚Äôm pretty sure they weren‚Äôt pure white!?!\nEdit: It is a great picture! I just thought that one thing looked a bit weird!', '15:45- Ok, I re checked my notes on SW history (because I was trying to write my own Star Wars graphic novel and I haven‚Äôt worked on it in a bit but I was on the second draft) and When Raven turned back to the light side of the force was 3,954 BBY and the ‚ÄúDawn of the Jedi‚Äù book took place in 25,793 BBY. So yeah, a lot more then 20k years!!!', '15:14- I wish I could talk to him face to face and ask him about this episode!?! Obviously the first clear question should be ‚Äúhow much of these episodes are exactly like how you wanted them to be?‚Äù Because there are a few things that don‚Äôt sound like there was much thought put in behind it and also into the future because of them! One would be if the Brother and the Sister were still alive during the 3rd year of the clone wars and their life keeps the peace then why has there been so much of the opposite of peace throughout the whatever amount of years since they were first created?!? It is kinda funny that with how old you said they might be it sounds like you think the Old Republic is the oldest thing in the SWU lol I‚Äôm pretty sure the first Jedi order or whatever they called themselves back then happened around 8,000 years before the Old Republic!?!', 'Allan, very Star wars looking hair style/hat ..

The Roman Republic died because of irreversible corruption.  The Roman Empire was the only way forward from there -aside from all its parts splintering off into separate groups -which is what the Clone Wars had just decided over in Star Wars.

I have always been one to plan ahead, and for the most part of my life, my plans have always come as I drew. And now, for the first time in my life in 2016, I realised I am not actually in control. All the ambitions and hardwork only to be stopped by some greedy people and their war for power.\nI got depressed and diagnosed with GAD after my kidnap. Struggled for 3 years loosing myself further and developing bad habits to help me ""feel good"" during this period of low. \nEventually took the birth of whom was to be my first son in 2020( at this point I was 20) to will myself out of the depression. Only to later findout that the kid is not mine. Managed to travel out of my country to finally be able to further my studies, only for my father to be killed 3 days after I left. \nI am trying my best to stay afloat. I am at a point where I do not know how to think for my future anymore. My mind is too clouded and everything is so hazy. I am doing my best not to slip back into depression but sometimes I fear that my strength won‚Äôt be enough. \nI am writing this comment to as for help. The last flame in my spirit has identified my past curiosity in cyber security and is trying to build on that and hopefully make a life for myself. So I can look after my aging mother and younger brother. I am 24 now and feel like this is the last attempt I might have, to finally feel like I can contribute not only to my life but to that of my loved ones. \nAt this point I am browsing professor messer‚Äôs channel and looking to take the COMPTIA NETWORK +, then the Security +. \nIf anyone, any one at all in this amazing community can provide me with any guidance at all at resources I could explore to make myself a better security engineer or expert?

These ""tools"" are applications that cost 10\'s of thousands, if not 100\'s, for these major corporations.

Most of us have worked in major corps and have been silo\'d into doing just a particular piece of the pie.

I just want to make one quick correction to the brother talking about robotic process automation.  The crazy part about robotic process automation is it has nothing to do with physical robots.\n\nRobotic process automation is meant to automate repetitive processes that people do with white collar jobs. Think data entry.  Let's say you have somebody that has to use a nine key to take data from one spreadsheet and import it into a piece of legacy software that is critical to the company.  You could replace the legacy software with a new system that could accept the spreadsheets directly , but that can cost tens of millions of dollars.  Instead you pay anywhere from 5 to 20 to 100 people depending on the size of the company $40,000 a year to do data entry.  Anybody that's ever worked at a bank, or an insurance company, or credit card processor knows exactly this kind of monotonous work.\n\nWhat's something like RPA does is it would read the characters in the spreadsheet program and then simulate typing the correct characters into the data entry program.  This piece of software my only cost $50,000 or $100,000 to build, but it would allow you to continue using your legacy software that will cost ten million dollars to replace, and get rid of those data entry people.  So you might pay $100,000 once to replace people that you're playing anywhere from $200,000 to four million dollars every year.\n\nIf you're interested, the big players in this industry are uipath and Microsoft's new PowerAutomate.

The Galaxy S4 i9500 is a bit better than the one you reviewed.', ""From using both of these as daily drivers, I found the S4 to be better overall when everything is kept as it is, while I found the G2 better after rooting and modding. Problems with the unmodded G2 is that the oversized on-screen buttons and unadjusted UI scaling give you no benefit from having the larger screen. The S4 has more true screen real estate in practice. Shrinking or auto-hiding the on-screen buttons and lowering dpi solves this. S4 battery life is worse, but better when using a backup battery in external charger (= practically infinite battery life). The LG camera badly needs a mod that increases the shutter speed; out of the box it's extremely laggy, even if considerably sharper than the S4's and optically stabilized. Both have oppressive UI skins, but I found Samsung's to be slightly more feature rich. Modding in split screen dual app functionality tilts things in LG's favor, but it might be possible on the S4 too. One major and not well known con of the G2 is its sub par touch input lag, which the S4 doesn't suffer from (this has been measured and the difference is noticeable), thus making the performance of the S4 feel better despite a theoretically weaker SOC. SD card slot on the S4 is an invaluable asset and the 32GB G2 loses the pricing battle from the S4.

Gemini is a generative AI assistant that can answer unique questions, summarize documents, and plan trips. \n \nFeatures:\nGemini has advanced features like natural language understanding (NLU), which helps it understand the context of what you're saying. Gemini can also perform complex tasks like coding, idea generation, and image generation. \n \nIntended use:\nGemini is designed to be more personal and adapt to your interests and preferences. Google Assistant is designed for more communal use on shared devices, like smart home gadgets. \n \nAvailability:\nGemini is the default assistant on the Pixel 9 family, but users can still choose to use Google Assistant. On Android devices, Gemini can perform some of the same tasks as Google Assistant, but some features may not be supported.

ChatGPT seems to have a row limit of sorts. EG when I told them to create a list of all books from the ""Little People Big Dreams"" series ChatGPT only prints out 30, whereas Gemini gives you 70. The series has over 100 books so I needed to ask both of them to give me more books, but I had to ask ChatGPT more often because it only prints out 30 rows.\n\nDuring creative writing I found almost all answers of Gemini to be far better than ChatGPT.

Gemini gave me 5 different answers, ChatGPT gave me one. And I really liked one of the solutions Gemini provided.

The post has the following text:\n\n""A man bought 99 iPhones and arranged them in a heart to propose to his girlfriend, and she still said no""\n\nText Analysis\n\nThe text in the image is a humorous anecdote about a man who went to an extreme length to propose to his girlfriend, only to be rejected.\n\nThe man\'s gesture is clearly intended to be romantic, but it is also somewhat extravagant. Buying 99 iPhones is a very expensive gesture, and it is likely that the man spent a significant portion of his savings on the phones.\n\nThe woman\'s rejection is surprising, given the man\'s elaborate proposal. However, it is possible that she was not impressed by the material display of wealth, or that she had other reasons for saying no.\n\nThe final line of the text, ""Because she knows that android is better,"" is a humorous addition that suggests that the woman\'s rejection may have been motivated by her preference for Android phones over iPhones.\n\nCultural Context\n\nThe story of the man who proposed with 99 iPhones was widely reported in the media in 2014. The story was met with a mix of reactions, with some people finding it romantic and others finding it excessive.\n\nThe story is a reminder that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to proposals. What one person finds romantic, another person may find over the top. It is important to consider the woman\'s personality and preferences when planning a proposal.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nThe story of the man who proposed with 99 iPhones is also a cautionary tale about the dangers of materialism. The man\'s focus on material possessions may have ultimately led to his girlfriend\'s rejection.\n\nIt is important to remember that love is not about money or possessions. It is about two people who care for each other and want to spend their lives together. If you are planning a proposal, focus on expressing your love for your partner in a way that is meaningful to them.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nChatGPT:\n\nThe image shows a humorous meme about a man who bought 99 iPhones, arranged them in the shape of a heart, and used them to propose to his girlfriend. Despite the grand gesture, she still said no. The text overlay at the top of the image reads:\n\n""A man bought 99 iPhones and arranged them in a heart to propose to his girlfriend, and she still said no üôÇ""\n\nBelow the image, there\'s a comment from someone named Xavier, which adds a comedic twist to the situation:\n\n""Because she knows that android is better.""\n\nThis joke plays on the ongoing rivalry between iPhone (iOS) and Android users, suggesting that the girlfriend rejected the proposal because she prefers Android phones over iPhones.', 'Funny! ü§£ü§£', 'gpt: *giving the answer*\nGemini: ""fy, ask ChatGPT this stupid questions, not me""', 'Great tyson edit after a long time', ""6:02 EXCEPT, there is a little trick my friend. the person is wearing 2 headphones and a watch, hence his value is (person 5+ 2 headphone 10 + 1 watch 1 = 16).

What would you do on it anyways? Watch YouTube?? Your TV has that. (Movies and YouTube depending on the tv) Play games? Go outside (too cold? Winter? Ever heard of snow angels and snowman? I don‚Äôt care.) or I have an idea! Go ask your loving parents who care for your health for some screen time! It‚Äôs not that hard! Enjoy it while you can, and I bet some kid might reply ‚ÄúbUT tHeY oNlY gIvE mE an hOuR a tImE!11!!!‚Äù That‚Äôs enough anyways! Kids without this limit end up in a far worse state of mind and life than you. Plus, why can‚Äôt you wait a little while for the downtime to turn off? If it‚Äôs a nighttime trigger, get some sleep! Or if it unlocks in the evening for only a little bit, YOU CAN WAIT. Give me ONE healthy or good thing that will come out of you getting infinite screen time or having your parents think they haven‚Äôt done enough. To help your mental state. But I‚Äôm just saying, I want everyone here to get the best quality and duration of life POSSIBLE. And it starts when you‚Äôre a kid. The limits will be over eventually, but since you‚Äôre young, it‚Äôs most critical that your mental state is being prepared for the best quality of life so you don‚Äôt drive away from it. (I‚Äôm not a parent but I‚Äôve learned much) I‚Äôm not convinced by any other false statistic from some website you clicked on after searching up ‚Äúhealthy benefits for elevated screen time on devices and no restrictions‚Äù. If you did search that up, you don‚Äôt want that, you just want some screen time on a social media app because you‚Äôre bored and have too little wit to stay healthy and go do something. And if you might say ‚ÄúWell my parents restrict me from music, and I love listening to it, and it‚Äôs not unhealthy to listen to music!‚Äù You‚Äôre right, but it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre upset that you have to wait less than a day to listen to what you enjoy! And because it makes you upset, it might be an issue, not because you think you‚Äôre on music too much, but because you get so upset when you have to wait a little while would signal not just impatience, but also lack of tolerance. And if you get 1 hour within 24 hours of a day, you gotta realize that it‚Äôs either ok to ask for a little more time, or just learn to have at least 1 day where your phone isn‚Äôt on your schedule. It will feel bad during the day, but in a while it changes your view and you will get used to not having your phone at access, which will eventually have you prefer a normal lifestyle. This will benefit your patience even while you still have downtime as a feature, benefiting everything you wish was. I‚Äôm covering this as well: ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to have downtime‚Äù or ‚Äúyou probably are just commenting this because you‚Äôve recently been relieved from downtime.‚Äù No. I still have it, but listen.

Me personally I'm looking for speed and battery life out of my device   I prefer to activate things that I use ocasionally manually if and when I need to , and not burden the system with choices it needs to make on its own.    With every new release of ios are new things to occupy the processors time and kill my battery.  Decisions that I personally don't want it making .     Thats why they have to keep making them faster , because theres new ways of spying on you and mining your data being invented every 5 minutes and the phones have to keep up with their nonsense...

If you listen to the recent video on YouTube concerning the latest Omnibus gun control act worked on, they bring up every mass shooting event that ever occurred in history. Except for ONE ""mass shooting"" got no mention. What is this ""mass shooting"" that the government doesn\'t even want to talk about. What is this event that in 1970 rocked the boat of the National Rifle Association, and caused every second amendment organization to literally ""freak out"" in the year 1970.\n  On May 4th 1970 members of the Ohio National Guard fired into a crowd of Kent State University demonstrators killing four, and wounding nine Kent State students. The impact of the shooting was dramatic. The event triggered a national wide student strike, that forced hundreds of colleges and universities to close.\n I find it sadly ironic that the demonstrators were demonstrating their displeasure over the war in Vietnam in general and the bombing in Cambodia in particular, carried out by President Nixon.\nWar is a ""mass shooting"" on a major scale ! .\nAs for the Second Amendment as currently written, I have some serious issues with it. It is poorly written, it is so poorly written and confusing that it must be reinterpreted by the Supreme Court. It does not explicitly say anything about self-defense. This has inspired me to write my new and improved version of the Second Amendment. I have named my new version.\n\nSecond Amendment 2.1\nIn order to maintain the blessings of liberty and freedom throughout the land.The pre-existing natural right of the individual to self-defense, shall always be upheld and protected. The right to manufacture, keep and bear arms ammunition, and parts and accessories for arms, will not be infringed or impeded. By any law or mandate, by either the states, or the federal government. A free market being necessary for a free people.The right to manufacture arms for sale, including, ammunition and accessories, for arms, will not be infringed or impeded. By any law or mandate.

Or any city or town, within a state. For any other moral reason. Uninfringed or impeded by law or mandate.\n\nAnd there you have it my new and improved version of the Second Amendment 2.1 and for further Clarity, let me explain the term ""pre-existing natural right of self-defense"". The Second Amendment to the Constitution was adopted December 15th 1791. The concept of self-defense was created and adopted after the Norman conquest of England in 1066.\nComing back up through time back to 1970 and the mass shooting event at Kent State University there was a famous rock and roll band called Crosby Stills Nash & Young they made a song called ""Ohio"". \nPrevious to their song was the song written and produced,1964, by a young Native Canadian singer-songwriter, Buffy Sainte-Marie, The universal Soldier. I consider her song. The Best anti-war Song Ever written by a human being on this planet.\n It is my most sincere hope that my version of the Second Amendment 2.1 will one day be recognized as being the best Second Amendment ever re-written, and adopted into law.\n\nAlso I highly recommend the following books, Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, Adventures in Legal Land, by Marc Stevens. Government Indicted, by Mark Stevens, Freedom from Government by Trent Goodbaudy, And Natural Law, by Lysander Spooner. :-)', 'Oklahoma doesnt play this crap. We are a 2nd amendment SANCUARY state.

I did my time seen fit by judge c.a. Woodall. Why am I still being punished after doing my time?', 'All gun rules, regulations, policies ordinances and laws are unconstitutional and MUST be removed!  Regarding the governments ability to impose ""Reasonable Restraint"" which has now become the mantra of our liberal influenced government.  \nSupporters of the bill of rights claim they have a constitutional or Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. Opponents counter even if it were the case, the government was granted the general power to place restraints on the right. Both of these assertions are based on a misconception concerning the intent of the document known as the Bill of Rights. \n\nWhen the Bill of Rights was submitted to the individual States for ratification, it was prefaced with a preamble. As stated in the preamble, the purpose of the Amendments was to prevent the government from ‚Äúmisconstruing or abusing its powers.‚Äù To accomplish this, ‚Äúfurther declaratory and restrictive clauses‚Äù were being recommended. The Amendments, when adopted, did not create any so-called constitutional rights or grant the government any power over individual rights; they placed additional restraints and qualifications on the powers of the  government concerning the rights enumerated in the Amendments.\n\nBy advancing the myth Amendments grant the American people their individual rights, the government has illegally converted enumerated restraints and qualifications on its power into legislative, executive, judicial and administrative power over individual rights. The government claims it was granted the constitutional authority to determine the extent of the individual rights enumerated in the Amendments and/or impose ‚Äúreasonable restraints‚Äù on those rights. This assertion is absurd. The government does not have the constitutional authority to ignore, circumvent, modify, negate or remove constitutional restraints placed on its power by the Amendments or convert them into a power over the individual right enumerated in the particular restraint.\n\nA denial of power or an enumerated restraint on the exercise of power is not subject to interpretation or modification by the entity the restraint is being imposed upon. The restraints imposed by the Amendments, which were adopted 4 years after the Constitution was ratified, override the legislative, executive, judicial or administrative powers of the  government. If this were not the case, then the restraints would be meaningless because the  government could simply circumvent, modify or remove them. Why would the States have requested and adopted enumerated restraints on government power, subsequent to their ratification of the Constitution, if the  government possessed the authority to nullify them?\n\nWhen the government infringes on one of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights it is not violating anyone‚Äôs constitutional rights; it is violating the additional restraint or qualification placed on its power by the particular Amendment where the right is enumerated. The distinction between rights and restraints is critical.  [The right is not given by the  Government.  Our rights are given by God and are inalienable.  Therefore, they can\'t be limited or taken away.]\n\nAs stated in the Declaration of Independence, the American people have unalienable rights that come from a higher source than government or a written document. By acknowledging people have natural rights, which are bestowed by a creator, the Founders laid the foundation for the principle the government does not have the lawful authority to take away or infringe on those rights. This principle was incorporated into the preamble and structure of the Amendments to secure individual rights from government encroachment; that is why they were designed and imposed as restraints on the exercise of power.\n\nIf the individual rights of the people had been created by the Constitution or an amendment to the document, then they would cease to be unalienable because the right would depend on the existence of a document. If the document or a provision of the document disappeared, so would the right. The belief individual rights were created by a written document has opened the door for the government to claim the power to define the extent of any right enumerated in an Amendment. This has transformed constitutional restraints placed on governmental power into subjective determinations of individual rights by the institutions of government. By failing to understand the difference between amendments that create rights and amendments that impose restraints on government, the American people are watching their individual rights vanish as they are reduced to the status of privileges bestowed by government because the constitutional restraints placed on governmental power are being replaced by government decree.\n\nOpponents of the Amendments always try to diminish the right enumerated in the Amendments by asserting rights are not absolute. This is just another straw man argument because the Amendment is about imposing a restraint of the powers of the  government concerning a right: not granting a right or defining the extent of a right. In addition, a review of the Second Amendment shows the restraint imposed by the Amendment does not contain any exceptions.\n\nLegal precedence supporting constitution and bill of rights. \n\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 US 137: ‚ÄúThe Constitution of these United States is the supreme law of the land. Any law that is repugnant to the Constitution is null and void of law.‚Äù\n\nMurdock v.

Are manual safety versions included or excluded?', 'I have a P320- X-Five. Really love it, it has just run some 500 rounds or so, no failures of any kind. I would like to know it the failures could involve X-Fives too.', 'Read through the lawsuit, thanks for linking it. My personal theory is that - while statistically almost certainly some of these documented reports are unintentional finger-on-trigger pulls - the prevalence of their occurrence with this particular firearm indicates something about the design, or the manufacturing of the design, disproportionately lends the weapon to be unintentionally discharged - even while holstered. All of the reports are of the weapon being fired while in gentle motion/twisting/bending/holstering/belting etc. I wonder if the lack of an interior trigger safety (allowing the trigger to be pulled or hinged from any point) combined with the width of the trigger reduces the tolerance in safe holster design around the trigger guard. I wish we had better documentation of the specific holsters being used for each of these incidents. It could be that because of this reduced tolerance, leather, or unrigid or misshaped kydex, may cause the holster itself to be pulling the trigger, creating an obstruction that bows into the trigger guard enough to pull it and fire. \n\nThe vast majority of these incidents involve issued carriers in some official capacity, not members of the general public. While I\'m unaware of what percentage of P320s are issued vs purchased by regular consumers, the different choices in holsters between the public and professionals - which financial incentives may be more likely to push cheap, damaged, worn, improper, etc. holsters on - could be the cause for this discrepancy. It could also be the case that this low tolerance combined with the polymer frame allows for bending of the firearm/triggerguard itself and could work to put the trigger into harm\'s way by bowing the triggerguard out of the way or the trigger towards the edges of the holster. The lack of tolerance also makes the P320 more dangerous when something *does* inadvertently end up in the holster. A casing, a twig, a piece of fingernail, etc. These are all much more likely to defeat the P320s trigger than a trigger with a trigger safety.\n\nI think that the P320s trigger design, when combined with a low quality or ill suited holster, or a dangerous but statistically ultimately inevitable foreign object winding up inside the holster are the cause for this one firearm spawning so many incidents of unintentional discharges.\n\nAt least one report involved a CAT scan and analysis of a weapon that fired while fully holstered and currently worn, supported by video evidence, identified manufacturing and design failures that contributed to the firing. *""crossed sear springs that apply upward spring pressure to the sear to keep it from releasing the striker."" (section 108. Page 18) which is compelling, but I don\'t know enough about P320 or striker pistol design to really weigh in on it. If legit, it\'s possible that similar failures are responsible for many of these incidents involving fully holstered weapons firing - I think it\'s safe to assume that some fair percentage of discharges during holstering/reholstering were inadvertently and unawaredly caused by finger-on-trigger contact.\n\nSig\'s language of ""voluntary upgrade"", their insistence that any handgun could fire if ""vibrated"", their stated following of U.S. regulations that they were aware categorically do not exist and thus could not have been followed, their rewording of their manuals in the face of controversy, and the outsourcing of their manufacturing leaves me with doubts as to exactly how safe the firearm may be independent of user error. Clearly, the lack of civilian incidents indicates that many P320s are fully capable of being carried daily in quality holsters by responsible owners without incident. But, I have a hard time believing that fingers-on-triggers are causing 100% of these incidents as some allege. I think the design could have been made safer to minimize these incidents, and Sig bears some responsibility for not making those design decisions. A manual safety on more models, a safer more-tolerant trigger design, better manufacturing QC, better stress testing could have caught many of these issues ahead of time, including the drop-safe problem. Sig can make a quality firearm, but everyone has a few lemons, and I think the 320 as manufactured real-world is unnecessarily dangerous relative to its peers.', 'If you notice there‚Äôs professionals, working a job where an accidental discharge on their part could result in termination or  disciplinary action.

Their opinions seemingly violate the law.\n\nNote: 26 USC is revenue law. 18 USC is criminal law - keep those in mind. \n\nSee the link. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5845\n\nAOW is not defined under title 18 (criminal). It is in 26 (tax). You can look up the definition. Let\'s break it down one comma at a time so to speak. So let\'s look at that in detail.\n\n======\n26 U.S. Code ¬ß\u202f5845(e)\nStatute: The term ‚Äúany other weapon‚Äù means any weapon or device capable of being concealed on the person from which a shot can be discharged through the energy of an explosive, \n\nRemark ; AR and AK pistols because of the actions cannot be concealed, (perhaps under a full length Matrix trench coat but ""on the person."" But this is not really the big point. It certainly can be argued in court.\n\n---\n\nStatute: a pistol or revolver having a barrel with a smooth bore designed or redesigned to fire a fixed shotgun shell, \n\nRemark ; AR and AK pistols do not have smooth bores. The Judge and similar that CAN fire 410 bore shot shells are legal because an AOW is the reverse - a smooth bore revolver or pistol capable of firing shot shells - not a typical rifled revolver or pistol capable shot shells. AR and AK pistols do not have smooth bores.  \n\n---\n\nStatute: weapons WITH COMBINATION shotgun and rifle barrels 12 inches or more, less than 18 inches in length, from which only a single discharge can be made from either barrel without manual reloading, and shall include any such weapon which may be readily restored to fire. \n\nRemark ; Think configurations of single-shot, Over & Under, rifle & shot gun (such as 410 bore / 22 break action sporting arms) whose dual barrels are 12"" and greater AND whose OAL (over all length) is less than 18."" (think about the first AOW requirement - concealability). Notice this phrase ""may be readily restored to fire"" (think modern ammunition - not muzzle loaders)\n\n---\n\nExclusions:\nSuch term SHALL NOT INCLUDE a pistol or a revolver having a rifled bore, or rifled bores, \n\n; AR and AK pistols have rifled bores. (exit argument here.) Notice a pistol or a revolver can only be an AOW if it has a smooth bore AND can fire shot shells.\n\n---\n\nExclusions ctd.:\nor weapons designed, made, or intended to be fired from the shoulder AND not capable of firing fixed ammunition.\n\nRemark ; Key: ""designed, made, or intended to be fired from the shoulder"" This is either rifles shotgun  ""and not capable of firing fixed ammunition."" Think muzzle loaders or even breech loaders providing they DO NOT FIRE AMMUNITION.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C., ¬ß 921(A)(17)(A) The term ‚ÄúAmmunition‚Äù means ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets, or propellant powder designed for use in any firearm.\n\n===\n\nThis is critical - ""pistol"" is not defined in either titles definition (show me if you can find it) - ""Handgun"" is.  And then, not in title 26 (revenue) but in title 18 (criminal). When you don\'t have something defined in the law, it defaults to common language which would make pistols handguns. OK so, what does the law say about pistols and revolvers? It says they are not AOWs PROVIDING they have rifled barrels.\n\nSee 18 U.S. Code ¬ß 921(29)The term ‚Äúhandgun‚Äù means‚Äî\r\n(A)a firearm which has a short stock and is designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand; and (B)any combination of parts from which a firearm described in subparagraph (A) can be assembled.\n\nSo A ""handgun"" is defined to be fired one handed. Shotguns and SBSs are smooth bore shot from the shoulder. Rifles and SBRs have rifled bores and shot from the shoulder. \n\n\nSee also Title 18 definitions https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921\n\n++++\n\nThere is a history of the ATF just making things up by caveat. Such as saying putting a pistol stabilizing brace to your shoulder ""makes or remakes"". There is no basis in law to defend this ATF opinion. It will stand until changed or challenged but using a screwdriver to chip ice does not magically ""make or remake"" a screwdriver an icepick. I can bark, but that won\'t make or remake me into a dog.  Another way to put it is a screwdriver or a baseball bat may be used as a deadly weapon but at no time did either stop being a screwdriver or baseball bat. \n\nExamine another ATF opinion seemingly not supported by law - the ATF have previously said adding a vertical rifle grip makes an AR or AK pistol into an AOW. \n\nWhat is the first requirement of an AOW? ""The term \'any other weapon\' means any weapon or device capable of being concealed on the person from which a shot can be discharged through the energy of an explosive,"" -- If an AR or AK pistol was not previously ""capable of being concealed"" then adding a vertical grip does not make it more concealable.\n\nRifles, shotguns, SBRs & SBSs are designed to be shot from the shoulder. Adding a second grip does not make it one of those does it. What it does is revert an AR or AK ""handgun"" into a ""firearm."" Just as Rifles, shotguns, SBRs & SBSs are designed to be shot from the shoulder, handguns are single handed. \n\nSo lets take the ATF\'s asinine logic as a reductio ad absurdum. If shouldering a pistol by the stabilizing brace magically  ""make or remakes"" a pistol into an SBR purely by how you hold it (i.e. no physical modifications) and adding a foregrip to a handgun makes it an AOW -- then by extension, everyone who uses a 2-handed grip on a pistol or revolver VIOLATES the NFA by ""making or remaking"" a pistol or revolver into an AOW. \n\nHere ends my questions and comments.', ""Is it boogaloo time?

It is an honor to serve the people of Georgia in the United States Senate, and I appreciate the opportunity to hear from you.\xa0\xa0On August 3, 2020, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) notified Q, LLC. that its Honey Badger Pistol with a stabilizing brace is subject to additional regulations under the\xa0National Firearms Act. I disagree with ATF‚Äôs decision on this matter. Millions of stabilizing braces are currently owned by lawful gun owners across our nation and in Georgia. This arbitrary decision made by unelected bureaucrats is a departure from the previous\xa0stance\xa0the ATF itself has held since 2012.\xa0\xa0\xa0In response, President Donald Trump suspended the ATF order for 60 days as the White House reviews the decision to ensure it will not interfere with the ability of law-abiding citizens to exercise their constitutional right to ‚Äúkeep and bear arms.‚Äù I sent a\xa0letter\xa0to the Department of Justice urging Attorney General Barr to remedy this issue. I stand with President Trump, and as a strong advocate for the Second Amendment, I will continue to closely monitor this situation.\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you again for contacting me. If you have any other questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. Your comments and opinions are a vital source of information to assist me in carrying out my duties as your U.S. Senator from Georgia. \nSincerely,\nÔøºSenator Kelly Loeffler', ""These pistol braces are made for the wounded and disabled veterans of this country and the atf is trying to make these hero's go to jail for owning them. i literally cannot comprehend what the ATF is doing."", 'i just contacted both my senator and representative expressing my issues on this topic. thank you for having the links in your description to make it easier.', 'They can go fuck themselves! Time for a gunfight', 'yeah Trump does not give a damn.  He changed his mind three times in one day about firearm regulations.  I am not a fan of feel good laws.  But those idiotic laws happen because law makers know the U.S. Constitution is inviolate. All of our leaders have taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath includes the modern SCOTUS interpretation of the 2a individuals ""right"" to own a firearm.     So law makers know they cannot overturn the 2nd amendment directly. That is not going to happen for a variety of reasons even if the democrats held both the house and senate.  The fact is a large majority of Americans are rightfully scared of guns. Those people don\'t understand the other half of America has had a long enduring relationship with firearms via hunting, scouting and other activities. All that part of society sees is more and more mass shootings, more gun violence one way or another.  Some of it is exploited by the media but much of it is reported accurately.  Insecurity makes people fear. Some people embrace there fear and decide to purchase guns (We see steep rises in gun and ammo sales after mass shootings). Other want to disarm everyone so they can feel safer.  Politicians try to sooth the population of Hoplophoic gun haters by passing what I call ""Feel good laws""  These laws do very little. They include gun and mag bans along with numbers of legislation designed to make ownership burdensome.   but I guarantee the 2nd amendment is safer in the hands of a mainstream moderate Democrat, Who kept his oath to support and defend the constitution, then with an autocrat that has attacked the very fabric of the Constitution. Don\'t fall for Trumps adds that say democrats want to abolish the amendment.  Because its not historically true.  Many Democratic leaders come from states like PA who are split on gun issues.  Democrats and republicans still answer to their constituents.   Trump cares nothing of his constituents.  He has repeatedly changed his mind on gun control and I would not be surprised if this has been Trumps plan all along.   ""May 24, 2019, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Canterbury to be Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives."" Republicans went nuts because Trump nominated an Anti Gunner to be the new head of ATF!  When the nomination stalled in committee Trump had to withdrawal it and nominated Regina Lombardo as Director.  Lombardo was a local agent that had no open opinions on gun control.  But we do know she was close to Canterbury and was an Attach√© Liaison agent to Canada\'s ATF in Toronto.  SO you put the puzzle pieces together.  ""O Canada Land of Gun Grabs""  My point is don\'t be pray to false rhetoric.  If Trump did not want this to happen he would of fired Lombardo.  You know that\'s true.  Trump has fired 91% of his staff.  That is the highest percentage of any President in modern history!  So I tell you again.  Why has he not simply replaced her.  The ATF and IRS both are considered ""Fluid"" in the way they can interpret and or enforce the law.  Yet the IRS and ATF have been tools of other Presidents.  Remember Fast and Furious.  That was Obamas attempt at pushing a false narrative.  He wanted to show how illegal guns made it across the border.  He used the ATF for his crusade and it backfired.  Now we are seeing Trump do the same thing.  To conclude if you want stability for our nation don\'t put your faith in a man who has already demeaned the only document that gives us the right to own firearms.  The Dems aren\'t going to take away your Guns.  Apparently that is what Trump is about to do with his new interpretation of importation restrictions.  We have a much better chance of keeping out 2nd amendment intact with Trump out. https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/23/how-trump-disparages-the-constitution/']",0.937,0.168,0.681,0.151

The Kirin 980 came out around the same time as Apple's A12 Bionic and while both were 7nm, the A12 beat the Kirin hands down in benchmark scores. No doubt, having access to TSMC allowed China to make better chips than they do now, but it's sensationalisation to say they were ahead of the rest just because they had access to the same lithographic machines. The truth is that they were not on top in chip design back then, and they are not on top even now."", ""I'm surprised you weren't asked about BDS Calling after 2K comments. Could you please give us some insight into it's BDS satellite calling capabilities? Is the app only available in Chinese Mandarin? Have you successfully acquired sync and called through BDS in the Americas and or Europe? Is the call quality any good is there a lag? How fast can you place a call, meaning how long does the app take to acquire sync and place the call? Once in sync can you freely start making calls back to back one after another without much delay? And have you been able to obtain some form of internet connectivity through BDS, like email, WeChat, WhatApp or news feed, etc?
